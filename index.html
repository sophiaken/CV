      I am a graduate from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with a master’s degree in Computer Science. I have got all the necessary technical training and analytical skills with a passion to work on cutting edge software technologies.
  My passion for programming and love for data analysis has motivated me to gain extensive knowledge on areas such as Data mining, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. In my master’s thesis, I have developed a “Robust Algorithm for Measuring Noise in Computer Tomography Examinations” and achieved an accuracy of 70% compared to the other existing models.  The algorithm was implemented in Jupyter notebook environment using Python Packages such as sklearn, pandas ,Keras , NumPy , PyDicom and generated a dataset using the CT meta scan parameters along with the robust noise measured from the images. The generated dataset was preprocessed, and appropriate features were extracted and ranked based on their importance using the SelectFromModel class available in sklearn(Python package). Used a data mining tool called Weka on the generated dataset to do the predictive analysis on the data using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest and Neural networks using Keras python which generated an accuracy of 93%.Furthermore, worked with a team of two on Artificial Intelligence Technology to develop an AI maze explorer that navigates the map by fighting obstacles to reach its goal using local search algorithm. Additionally, I have worked on Big data technologies such as Apache spark to analyze large chunks of data in movies dataset. I have utilized data visualization tools such as python’s matplotlib , Plotly and Tableau(created dashboards and stories for two popular datasets i.e. Super Store and  Airbnb NYC.Being an International student has given me the opportunity to interact and work with diverse groups of people which has enhanced my overall interpersonal communication abilities. I have also taken up leadership role as a Graduate student Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering where I supported in guiding students, graded assignments, exams and helped in evaluating the performance of the students.
